I keep hearing that AI strips away the soul of craft. It only does that when you abdicate intent. Treat the models as collaborators with sharp guardrails:

- **Drafting:** Let the copilot outline, then rewrite the hook yourself.
- **Refactoring:** Ask for edge-case hunts, but keep domain logic in your head.
- **Distribution:** Use AI to repurpose snippets, not to invent what you never said.

These simple constraints help me keep a consistent voice while shipping more.

### Tools I lean on

- Cursor for exploratory coding sprints.
- V0 for wireframes when time-boxed to 20 minutes.
- My own prompt library stored beside the codebase, versioned just like any other artifact.

Taste is a backlog item. Automate everything else so you can invest more in it.
