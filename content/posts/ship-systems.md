The fastest teams I work with have one thing in common: they build **systems** before they obsess over fireworks. Systems look boring on day one but compound into unfair advantages.

## A system for everything

1. **Signals** - what questions matter now?
2. **Inputs** - which users unlock momentum?
3. **Loops** - how do we feed learning back into the roadmap?

When every launch connects back to those three loops, ship velocity no longer depends on heroics.

## The automation layer

Automation is the connective tissue. In my personal stack:

```text
Linear -> Notion -> GitHub -> Website -> LinkedIn
```

A small Node script ingests Markdown, populates the blog JSON, and hits the LinkedIn UGC API. One command, two distribution channels.

## Action items

- Write a short memo titled "How we decide what to build".
- Automate one distribution workflow this week.
- Review the system monthly. Prune aggressively.

The point is not to automate empathy. It is to free up more cycles for it.
